Go Language
	Is an open source programming language for making programmers more productive.
	Expressive Allows programmers to be expressive in the way of logic and intent by a1llowing to write code containing understandable syntax.
	Concise upto the exact mark minimalistic syntax no unnecessary keywords,garbage and automatic formatting gofmt.
	Clean Code uniformity and easy to read. Discourages unnecessary abstraction	
	Efficient Directly converts to Machine Code Go -> Binaries.

Statically Typed and Compiled Language but fast.

For managing packages and libraries that are from other modules use go.mode (similar purpose of package.json)
For initializing and creating mod file (use go.mod ) -> go mod init
go mod tidy  ->install dependencies.

By default if multiple files need to be executed go run will check for package main in program and executes main() fn.
Packages -> Like java declare package <name>
go compiler needs an executable prgm to be in package main.
fmt->Formatting text and printing to console. Like o/p formatting etc.
Like python no semicolon.
Main is executed by default.

Why package main is used:
	Clear Seperation between Executables and Libraries.(user defined names are used for portability).
	Consistent Entry Point
	Efficient Compilation
	Modular and Scalable Design
	Cross Platform
